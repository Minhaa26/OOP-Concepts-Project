# Object Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts Project

This repository contains simple and well-structured code examples
based on the given syllabus. The main purpose of this project is
to understand programming fundamentals and Object-Oriented
Programming concepts using practical implementations.

## 1. Data Types

Data types define the type of data that a variable can store in memory.
They help the compiler understand how much memory is required and
what operations can be performed on the data.

### Common Data Types:
- int: Stores whole numbers
- float: Stores decimal numbers
- char: Stores a single character
- bool: Stores true or false values

File:
DataTypes/datatypes.cpp

---

## 2. Variables

A variable is a named memory location used to store data values.
Variables allow programs to store, update, and use data during execution.

### Example:
A variable can store age, marks, or any numerical value.

File:
Variables/variables.cpp

---

## 3. Loops (For Loop)

Loops are used to execute a block of code multiple times.
The for loop is mostly used when the number of iterations is known
before the execution of the loop.

### Advantages:
- Reduces code repetition
- Improves program efficiency

File:
Loops/for_loop.cpp

---

## 4. Arrays

An array is a collection of elements of the same data type
stored at contiguous memory locations.

### Types of Arrays:

### 4.1 One Dimensional Array (1D)
Stores elements in a single line or list.

### 4.2 Two Dimensional Array (2D)
Stores elements in rows and columns (matrix form).

### 4.3 Three Dimensional Array (3D)
Stores data in multiple layers.

Files:
Arrays/array_1D.cpp  
Arrays/array_2D.cpp  
Arrays/array_3D.cpp

## 5. Class and Object

A class is a blueprint or template used to create objects.
An object is a real-world entity created from a class.

### Example:
A class "Student" can have attributes like id and name.

File:
OOP/class_object.cpp

---

## 6. Inheritance

Inheritance allows one class to acquire the properties
and behaviors of another class.

### Benefits:
- Code reusability
- Easy maintenance
- Improved readability

File:
OOP/inheritance.cpp

---

## 7. Polymorphism

Polymorphism means "many forms".
It allows the same function name to behave differently
depending on the object.

### Example:
Function overriding using base and derived classes.

File:
OOP/polymorphism.cpp

---

## 8. Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the process of wrapping data and functions
into a single unit (class).
It helps in data hiding and protects data from unauthorized access.

### Key Concept:
- Private data members
- Public getter and setter methods

File:
OOP/encapsulation.cpp

---

## 9. Abstraction

Abstraction hides implementation details and shows only
essential features to the user.

### Achieved Using:
- Abstract classes
- Pure virtual functions (interfaces)

File:
OOP/abstraction.cpp
